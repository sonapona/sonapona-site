That's all the sounds in toki pona! writing them is very simple: you never use consonants,
with one exception: writing unofficial words.

## unofficial words

Sometimes, people loan words into toki pona, primarily names. These words are always
capitalised when you write them.

for example,

> mi tan ma Mesiko

means

> i am from Mexico

Notice how Mesiko is capitalised: this is because it's not a word found in toki pona
dictionaries, but rather a word from another language.
