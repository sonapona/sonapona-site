# grammatical vocabulary

## li

li is one of the most important words in toki pona.

li is responsible for marking the predicate. the word after li is the predicate of
a sentence. for example, in the sentence

> jan li moku

"moku" is the predicate. this means that "jan" is doing something related to food.
either "jan" is food, or "jan" is eat(ing). context is important for determining
the meaning of a sentence. generally, it's easy to distinguish whether something
is the thing being eaten or the thing eating just by what it is. people generally
don't get eaten, they normally eat things.

## mi and sina

mi and sina have an invisible "li" after them.

these two sentences are the same:

> mi pona

> sina li moku

and these two sentences are the same:

> sina pona

> sina li pona

## e

e is also a very important word in toki pona, as it indicates who's on the other
end of the predicate. this can be roughly translated as "to."

> jan li pona

this means that a person is doing something related to being good. since they're
not doing it to anything in particular, they're just being good in general. but
when you add an e to the sentence, it means that the person is being good *to* someone
in particular.

> jan li pona e ona

this means that the person is "good-ing" someone or something. this can mean that
they're healing them, or that they're reparing a thing. in loose terms, "jan"
is making "ona" become "pona."

this applies to other concepts as well.

> mi moku e ona

since "mi" is making "ona" become "moku", this probably means that "mi" is eating
"ona" or "mi" is making "ona" into food. as stated before, context is imporant
to determining the meaning of sentences.
